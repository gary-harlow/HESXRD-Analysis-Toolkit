Overview
======

HAT is a Software package for the analysis of high-energy surface x-ray diffraction data.
This softwares allows one to extract meaningful data from stacks of images such as those
produced in high-energy-surface x-ray diffraction experiements.

It is designed to be user-friendly and fairly quick so that it can be easily used during an experiment

Thanks for checking it out.

Getting Started
--------------

Read the paper: "HAT: A high-energy surface x-ray diffraction analysis toolkit"
(link to follow shortly)

This will describe the fundemenal theory and thinking behind the software. 

* Then, read :doc:`the install guide</install>` for instructions on installing HAT.

* Next, :doc:`move onto the tutorial </tutorial>`
