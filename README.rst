HAT: HESXRD-Analysis-Toolkit (xray-hat)
======

HAT is a Software package for the analysis of high-energy surface x-ray diffraction data.
This softwares allows one to extract meaningful data from stacks of images such as those
produced in high-energy-surface x-ray diffraction experiements.

It is designed to be user-friendly and fairly quick so that it can be easily used during an experiment

Thanks for checking it out.

All documentation is in the "``docs``" directory and online at
https://docs.xray-hat.com/en/stable/. If you're just getting started,
here's how we recommend you get started

Read the paper: "HAT: A high-energy surface x-ray diffraction analysis toolkit"
(link to follow shortly)

This will describe the fundemenal theory and thinking behind the software. 

* Then, read ``docs/install.txt`` for instructions on installing HAT.

* Next, work through the tutorial (``docs/tutorial.txt``).
