# HESXRD-Analysis-Toolkit
Software for the analysis of high-energy surface x-ray diffraction data

This softwares allows one to extract meaningful data from
stacks of images such as those produced in high-energy-surface
x-ray diffraction experiemnts. 

Images can be addressed via image number, or angle if that is available.
Stacks can be converted to reciprocal space units, and rotations of stacks
(where there is angle information) can also be cut to produce an in-plane map. 

It is designed to be user-friendly and fairly quick so that it can
be easily used during an experiment. For there are some limitations in that the 
in-plane lattice vectors are expected to be 90 degrees.

For more general reciprocal space transformaitons abd binning
See the ESRF Binoculars software.
